    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <h3>-- A brief writeup about our project.</h3>
    <p>We are interested in the population distribution of Northeastern’s 
      Peer Tutoring Program. We are eager to answer our partner’s questions on 
      how to improve the peer tutoring service to all undergraduate students. For 
      example, we are going to find out tutoring hours distribution of classes 
      in different colleges. We are going to find out types of tutoring sessions 
      in different colleges. We would like to use our 
      visualization techniques to display the improvements that our Peer Tutoring 
      Program could do to enhance all students’ academic performance.</p>


    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    <p> The challenge that the Treemap tries to solve is 
      <b>to show how many hours of tutoring each college takes up per session/hour</b>, which is a new task we identified.
      In the meanwhile, this treemap solved the tasks that we planned in P3, including 
      <b>Creating interaction between user and visualization by showing the relevant information of specific data</b>, 
      <b>Visualizing the instructor information among different classes</b>, 
      and <b>Discovering the most popular classes as well</b>. 

    <p>Our pie chart visualization <b>shows the distributions of different types of tutoring format services among all colleges 
      in Northeastern University</b>, which help to <b>tutor distribution among colleges</b>. 
    </p>



    <p>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</p>
    
    <p> 
      <small>
        <b>Usage of Treemap </b>
        To play with the first visualization, the user could click the rectangles to see more details in its inferior layer. For example, 
      when clicking the "College Of Science", the users could have a look at the courses which were provided tutoring sessions in this 
      college. Clicking the "PHYS1145", users could know there are three professors teaching this class, and the tutoring hours for each 
      section are 72.5, 56, and 34 hours. To zoom out the detailed view, users could click the upper orange bar, which indicates tutoring 
      hours in sum and in each college, each course. 
      </small>
    </p>

    <p> 
      <small>
        <b>Usage of Bar chart & Pie chart </b>
          To play with the second visualization, the user could place the cursor on either the bars or the piece of the pie chart. 
          When having his/her mouse over the COS bar, the pie chart could show off the distribution of the percentage of each tutoring 
          session type. When focusing on the One_on_One_In_Person type, the bars on the left side display the share of different colleges 
          of this kind of tutoring session.

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>

    <p>The task we prioritize in the first visualization is discovering the most popular class based on its tutoring hours and 
      identifying the instructor information at the same time. Since our application is a Treemap table, it has a complete hierarchy. 
      Our team breaks down the dataset containing a large amount of data through this table and shows the most outstanding values 
      (courses requiring a large number of tutoring resources) by the size of the area. The dataset also contains information on sections 
      taught by professors, so we also want to be able to show which professor's students in a particular course need more tutoring. 
      Because it also shows how well the students understand the professor's teaching style. If we can get answers to the above questions, 
      we can help PTP organizations better deploy tutors and tutoring sessions to different courses. And in a sense, we can also identify 
      the most popular teachers with the most engaging teaching style.
    </p>

    <p>The second visualization contains a bar chart(left) and a pie chart(right). The two charts are linked together.
       When the user has a mouse over on the bars of the bar chart, the pie chart could show off the distribution of each type of
       tutoring with a different color. When the user has mouse over on the pie chart, the bar chart on the left side could display 
       the number of hours of this specific tutoring type in each college. We transferred the visualization from a bar chart(left) 
       to a pie chart(right) since the pie chart can show the proportion of each tutoring format better than the stacked bar chart.
       In this way, users can have a clear view of which tutoring format uses most in one particular college/center/program.
       And it’s better for them to compare one tutoring format to another, and compare the sum of all tutoring sessions among 
       different colleges/centers/programs. We also consider the visualization usage for photosensitive people, so we choose the less 
       saturated colors to present the bar chart and pie chart with great aesthetic pleasure.

    instead. To provide as much as information to our audiences, we write our explanations in details. We are eager to present 
    the whole visualization-building process to our users thoughly and accurately via the slides.
